My solution for Kaggle Spaceship Titanic challenge, predicting passenger transport status using feature engineering and an optimized XGBoost model. By decomposing categorical features (e.g., cabin deck/side) and handling missing values strategically, the model achieved top 15% performance (80% accuracy). Further tuning could bridge the gap to top-tier results.
